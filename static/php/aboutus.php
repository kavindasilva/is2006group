<p>
	Our motherland's future leaders in the arena of female, who run the country forward indeed must be full of humanitarian qualities with wisdom (according to the teaching of Lord Buddha the WISDOM means the ability to understand the four noble truths, practice them and succeeding all the problems forever). The balanced lifestyle is compulsory to have a quality life in all concern.<a id="badge" name="badge"></a><span style="color:#FFFFFF;">The Badge</span>

	Our Vision<br />
</h3>
<p>
Our purpose is to establish within each student biblical values and principles for living, and to provide each child with an excellent education that enables maturity to personalities of high integrity, competence and compassion. The school recognizes that parents are most accountable before God for the nurture of their children in the way of the Lord. Therefore the school functions as an extension of the home, with a child’s home, church, and school acting as partners in helping the student to grow in discipleship and establish her ability to centre all relationships and lifestyle on obedience to God’s Word. The training of students at Methodist College will ensure that every aspect of learning, including understanding, Decision Making, and serving, is an extension of Christian Values.
